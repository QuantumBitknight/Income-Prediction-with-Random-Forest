# Random-Forest
Built an ensemble of decision trees. 
Built an ensemble of decision trees. I trained each tree on a different, random subset of our data and a random selection of features. Finally, I combine all the trees predictions to get a more accurate and robust result than any single tree could achieve on its own. And improved accuracy by 85%.
